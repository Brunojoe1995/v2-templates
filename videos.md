# v2 Videos

Here are short videos to show you how to install Coder OSS and create templates. Templates are Terraform scripts that define how a Coder OSS workspace will be built. e.g., on what compute, which IDEs will be installed and started.

# Install Coder OSS
- [on a Mac with Docker Desktop](https://www.loom.com/share/a6422044758048cc901f339bc6cd91d1)
- [on a Kubernetes cluster with Helm](https://www.loom.com/share/2bfcf681185541e5be575818f1f85680)
- [Configuring TLS with cert-manager](https://www.loom.com/share/7353f6876db54464888cd01dba9bce6c)

# Working with templates
- [Here's a demo](https://www.loom.com/share/7af0f1cd36d64ff8872804085d0a6dcc) on creating a Terraform template and a developer workspace. In this example, we add code-server, our popular OSS project that runs VS Code in a browser. The demo includes port forwarding a Node React app to test in a browser. We also show using local VS Code and SSH.

# JetBrains IntelliJ and Gateway
- [Here is a demo](https://www.loom.com/share/140d942e6a574ccaadff5e564a14f395
) of both updating a Terraform template and creating a Kubernetes pod workspace with JetBrains IntelliJ for Java development. We show how to use IntelliJ both in a browser and also locally with JetBrains Gateway.

# Python and Data Science use cases
- Coder OSS supports all types of developer use cases including data science. [Here is a demo](https://www.loom.com/share/c9d489ce08c1496c822f42d0111833a4) creating a Terraform template and Docker container workspace with VS Code, Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab IDEs.
- [Here is a demo](https://www.loom.com/share/a79839c33a6443b1a485c59c20722893) creating a Python and JetBrains PyCharm workspace.
